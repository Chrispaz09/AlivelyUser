# AlivelyUser

What is AlivelyUser? Let's start with what it's not. It's not a secure api (yet) and not meant to apply every aspect of a production api. Alively is a RESTful api that uses CRUD operations and other services used for logins or signups. It's a project meant to interact with AlivelyMVC to allow users to create their own account and manage their goals and tasks. Also displays some of my knowledge of APIs.
