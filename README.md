# AlivelyUser

What is AlivelyUser? Let's start with what it's not. It's not a secure api (yet), not meant to apply every aspect of a production api. Alively is a project that is going to interact with AlivelyMVC to allow users to create their own account and manage their goals and tasks. Also displays some of my knowledge of APIs. It's a RESTful api project that uses CRUD operations and other services used for logins or signups.
